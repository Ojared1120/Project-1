Data Analysis Responsibilities:
	• Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Organize the ADIDAS sales data obtained through Kaggle into separate datasets for analysis. 
		The data cleaning and preprocessing will be as follows:
		○ We will save the raw data in it's own folder
		○ We will take that raw data and save it into separate CSV files for analysis 
			- Data set 1 - 5 CSVs for each region (Northeast, Southeast, South, Midwest, West)
			- Data set 2 - 3 CSVs sorted out by sales method (In-Store, Outlet, Online)
		○ We will also save our images and shape files for the visualizations into their own files
	
	• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform in-depth EDA to understand sales trends by region, state, sales method, and product category. 
		We will be answering the following questions:
		○ What are overall sales trends by region and by state? 
		○ What are overall sales trends by sales method (In-Store, Outlet, Online)?
		○ Volume of sales by product category?
			- Which is the most profitable product category?
		○ What is the most profitable states by sales totals compared to US census data? 
		○ Which retailer is performing best by region? 
			- Which retailer is most profitable?
		• Data Visualization: Create various plots like line plots, bar plots, pie charts, and map visualizations to effectively present the findings. Specifically, focus on creating the heat map visualization for regional sales by volume.
		Charts and graphs list:
			- Heat map segmented by regional sales totals 
			- Totals by region - bar chart
			- Highest sales by state - bar chart
			- Totals by retailer - pie chart
			- Totals by product type - pie chart
			- Totals by sales method type - pie chart
			- Highest retailer by region - pie charts
	
	• GitHub and README: We will upload the complete analysis to GitHub and create a detailed README file covering the project's objective, data, methodology, findings, and conclusions/recommendations. We will also include task tracking and documenting who on the team did what.
	
Business Analysis Responsibilities:
	• Insights and Recommendations: We will analyze the data insights gained by the data analysis to derive actionable insights for improving sales performance and our recommendations to the retailer.
	• Slide Deck: The group will collaborate on creating the slide deck to effectively present the data, findings, and recommendations during the group presentation. 
	• Group Presentation: We will prepare content for the 10-minute group presentation, summarizing the findings, recommendations, and actionable insights. Our rough presentation plan is as follows:
		  ○ 30 seconds for intros
		  ○ 4-5 minutes for EDA explanation
		  ○ 2 minutes to discuss visualizations
		  ○ 2 minutes for our business analysis and recommendations
		  ○ 30 seconds for our conclusion
		*see the presentation flow in the presentation folder for actual presentation order
