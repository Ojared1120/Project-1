Data Analysis Responsibilities:
	• Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Organize the ADIDAS sales data obtained through Kaggle and US Census data into separate datasets for analysis. The data cleaning and preprocessing will be as follows:
		○ We will save the raw data in it's own folder 
		○ We will take that raw data and save it into separate CSV files for analysis 
			- Data set 1 - CSV to analyze the data by state
			- Data set 2 - 5 CSVs for each region (Northeast, Southeast, South, Midwest, West)
			- Data set 3 - 3 CSVs sorted out by sales method (In-Store, Outlet, Online)
		      ○ We will have a separate folder for merged data
			- Data set 4 - Sales data by state 
	
	• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform in-depth EDA to understand sales trends by region, state, sales method, and product category. This will include utilization of US Census Data API. We will be answering the following questions:
		○ What are overall sales trends by region and by state? - Kyle
		○ What are overall sales trends by sales method (In-Store, Outlet, Online)? - Sara
		○ Volume of sales by product category? - Jared
			- Which is the most profitable product category?
		○ What is the most profitable states by sales totals compared to US census data? - Primary: Jared; Secondary: Sara; Group will work through this together
		○ Which retailer is performing best by region? To determine which retailer is most profitable. - Kyle
	
	• Data Visualization: Create various plots like line plots, bar plots, pie charts, and map visualizations to effectively present the findings. Specifically, focus on creating the heat map visualization for regional sales by volume.
		○ Question 1 - totals by region - bar chart
			- heat map by region - map with large to small dots based on sales totals
		○ Question 2 - totals by retailer - bar chart (?)
		○ Question 3 - totals by product type - pie chart
		○ Question 4 - totals by sales method type - pie chart
		○ Question 5 - highest retailer by region - pie
	
	• GitHub and README: We will upload the complete analysis to GitHub and create a detailed README file covering the project's objective, data, methodology, findings, and conclusions/recommendations. We will also include task tracking and documenting who on the team did what.
	
Business Analysis Responsibilities:
	• Insights and Recommendations: We will analyze the data insights gained by the data analysis to derive actionable insights for improving sales performance and our recommendations to the retailer.
		○ Retailer Analysis: Included in our recommendations we will determining which retailer is performing best by region and identify the most profitable retailer based on sales data.
	• Slide Deck: The group will collaborate on creating the slide deck to effectively present the data, findings, and recommendations during the group presentation. Sara will create the initial framework.
	• Group Presentation: We will prepare content for the 10-minute group presentation, summarizing the findings, recommendations, and actionable insights. Our rough presentation plan is as follows:
		  ○ 30 seconds for intros
		  ○ 4-5 minutes for EDA explanation
		  ○ 2 minutes to discuss visualizations
		  ○ 2 minutes for our business analysis and recommendations
		  ○ 30 seconds for our conclusion

Work Schedule
Monday 07/24: Preliminary work and project planning
Wednesday 07/26: Start work and hopefully finish EDA
